<p style="font-size:20px">Unemployment has both individual and social consequences that require public policy interventions.
 When it comes to individual consequence, unemployment can cause psychological distress, which can lead 
 to a decline in life satisfaction. It can also lead to mood disorders and substance abuse. Unemployment 
 can affect one’s social status ascription as well, which manifests through b, labelling, unfair judgement, 
 and marginalisation. Both these consequences can be mitigated through public policy interventions such as
 social support for the unemployed, but the design of such interventions can be limited by the lack of a detailed
 understanding of the consequences of being unemployed</p>

 <p  style="font-size:20px">Another mental health challenge that unemployed individuals often face is anxiety. The impact of unemployment also reaches out to
 the community and society in which the unemployed person lives. While one unemployed person will typically not have a significan
 t impact on society, high unemployment rates in certain areas often lead to higher poverty rates and poorer communities that amplify
 the societal impact of unemployment.

      <h1 style="color:#0000ff">Ways we can reduce unemployment in our country</h1>
         </center>


<font style="font-size:20px"><b>Encourage entrepreneurship</b>

People in different communities must be taught about entrepreneurship.
 This will help communities not to wait for the government to provide jobs for them.
 People will start small business and able to create job opportunities to others. 
 And entrepreneurship will also bring stability in our economy. When many people have businesses,
 our economy will be stable, and parents must teach their children about business. 
 When they are still young so that they will grow up know the importance of entrepreneurship.

<p><b>Support for entrepreneurship and small businesses</b></p>

Funding of people so that they can start their businesses important as many people they do not have enough money
 to start businesses from the ground.
<br>
<p><b>Education and training</b></p>

 <p>Education and training is needed in our society, when we are educated it will be easy for people to get jobs.
 Because we will be having the knowledge that employers need for us to be employed. Youth should be encouraged
 people to study. Education will open doors for them, and it will reduce the high rate of unemployment in the 
 country. The government must provide training centres so that we will be trained for jobs, internships and 
 learnerships will prepare us for jobs.
