<p><h1 style="color:#0000ff" ><center>One of the most important things that bothers our communities that's under Depressants is ALCOHOL.There is a high level of alcohol intake in all the communities in which that is channelled or influenced by a lot of reasons.</center>
 </h1></p>
<h1 style="color:#0000ff" >What is alcohol?</h1>
<font style="font-size:20px">An alcohol is any organic compound whose molecule contains one or more hydroxyl groups attached to a carbon atom.
Is a colourless volatile flammable liquid which is produced by the natural fermentation of sugars and is the intoxicating constituent of wine, beer, spirits, and other drinks, and is also used as an industrial solvent and as fuel.
Liquor is classed as a 'soothing entrancing' drug, which implies it acts to push down the focal sensory system at high dosages. 
At lower portions, liquor can go about as an energizer, actuating sensations of happiness and chattiness, however drinking an excess of liquor at one meeting can prompt sluggishness, respiratory discouragement (where breathing turns out to be slow, shallow or stops completely), unconsciousness or even demise.

<p><h1 style="color:#0000ff" >There are several reasons why people take alcohol:</h1>
<font style="font-size:25px">
<li>Past experiences
<li>Stress
<li>Social norm
<li>Environment
<li>Accessibility
<li>As an Act of Rebellion
<li>Peer Pressure
</font>
</p>
<p>
<font style="font-size:20px">
<p><b>1.Past experiences</b></p>
Past experiences with alcohol help to shape people’s current value and the expectations that they place on drinking alcohol. Alcohol users may recall their previous positive experiences with alcohol, and this may increase their motivation to drink. A negative experience will do the opposite.
<p><b>2. Stress</b></p>
People going through a stressful period in their life may value drinking alcohol more highly, because it helps to alleviate their negative feelings. The drinking removes, at least temporarily, the stress of anxiety.</h3>
<p ><b>3. Social norm</b></p>
Social norms are the behavioural expectations within a community. Alcohol is used at specific events and regular times for example, it is expected that alcohol would be served at most parties and weddings.</h3>
<p ><b>5. Environment </b> </p>
Exposure to alcohol-related cues increases the craving for alcohol, for example TV programmes, advertisements at events etc. On the other hand, financial influence, such as taxation, makes drinking less attractive. Evidence shows that simply raising the price of an alcoholic beverage by 10 percent reduces alcohol consumption by 7 percent</h3>
<p><b>6. Accessibility</b></p>
This is a very simple reason. People drink because alcoholic drinks are quite accessible. In most families, drinking alcohol is a very common thing among adults. Alcohol is also readily available in most supermarkets.</h3>
<p ><b>7. As an Act of Rebellion</b></p>
Some drink alcohol to be a rebel. They want to defy the rules and show that they are different from all the others. This is often seen among youngsters especially teenagers who are in the process of growing up – the adolescence factor.</h3>
<p><b>8. Peer Pressure</p></b>
Peer pressure is one of the most prominent reasons for drinking among people of all categories. Being afraid that you might be isolated or discarded from a group of people and doing an activity. Teenagers especially are more vulnerable to being affected by this which can make them become addicted as they are being pressurised to drink more than they want.</h3>
<p><b>9. For Fun</b></p>
People generally tend to drink alcohol to have fun. If people are nervous in social situations, drinking helps them relax and have more fun. People drink to have fun at parties, nightclubs, barbecues, and more, because they think alcohol enhances their experience. 
Over all the reasons mentioned above, each has their outcomes and different types of influences on the people around them.
</font>


<p><h1 style="color:#0000ff" >How does the intake of too much alcohol affects the body?</h1>
<font style="font-size:20px">The cerebrum depends on a sensitive equilibrium between synthetics and cycles. 
Liquor is a depressant, which implies it can upset that equilibrium, influencing our considerations, sentiments, and activities – and some of the time our drawn-out psychological wellness.
This is halfway down to synapses, which are synthetics that assistance to send signals from one nerve (or neuron) in the mind to another. 
As we drink more, the effect on our cerebrum work increments. Furthermore, paying little mind to the mind-set we're in, with expanding liquor utilization, it's conceivable that negative feelings will assume control over, prompting an adverse consequence on psychological well-being.
Liquor can be connected to animosity and certain individuals report getting upset, forceful, restless, or discouraged when they drink.

<p><h1 style="color:#0000ff" >How does it affect the lives of our kinds/what is it that kids learn from the parents who are drinking around them?</h1></p>
<p><font style="font-size:20px">It is a good thing to know and understand as parents that our children learn a lot from us. One may ask the question “what is it that they are learning?”. It is very important that we get to know or be careful of the things we do before of our children.
They do not know what is good or bad unless they can be taught or told that this is right or wrong. If not, they will do what they see the parents doing. When talking about “parent”, we not regarding to their biological parents, but just anyone who is older than them. 
As parents you must always take care of your children. Know of their where about and the people they associate themselves with. That is a good way of guiding you children in what to do and not what to do.</p> 
<p>If they are associating themselves with other people, you know they are not of a good influence, try to make them stay away from those people for bad company corrupt good morals.
As a parent if you know you are drinking alcohol of any kind, DO NOT DRINK INFROND OF YOUR CHILDREN!!! As mentioned above, children do what they see their parents doing. That can affect the children or give them the impression that drinking alcohol is a good idea. The reason why these days there is large number of young people drinking alcohol might be because they saw their parents doing it.
In that way, you won’t have the power to rebuke them to stop drinking because they saw you / learned that from you. Let’s do the right thing and stop drinking alcohol before our children.
</font></p>

<p><h1 style="color:#0000ff" >What can be done to help the students stop drinking alcohol?</h1></p>	

<p><font style="font-size:20px">It is evident that substances abuse is negatively impacting the society. It is therefore of paramount importance that we support and help our youth / students to stay away from substances by finding a sponsor from a local rehab to help them. 
Talk to them by informing them how harmful the substances are on their bodies, that they must find new hobbies, do exercises, and make them realise how their studies are much more important. There’s a better life outside the use of substances.</p>
<p>Most of the people take alcohol as something that they can rely on when they are not okay, drinking alcohol is their way of healing or avoiding stress. The intake of alcohol is not a way of escaping problems but a way of making them even worse. The truth still stands, the problems will still be there even after drinking alcohol.
 The reasons why the intake of alcohol is high is due to stress, job loss (Unemployment). Some of the people after alcohol they go and practise GBV in their families or partners. The outcomes/output of the alcohol input/intake are job loss, GBV practice, one may lose their lives, one might end up in prison under different situations/circumstances due the influence of alcohol in you. 
 Let us be aware as a community that the lives of our people matter. Let us find a way to help anyone who is addicted to alcohol in which it has its own way of destroying one’s life.
