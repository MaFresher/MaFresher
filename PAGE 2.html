<h1 style="color:#0000ff" >What is substance abuse? </font></h1>
<font style="font-size:20px"><p>Substance abuse is the use of illegal drugs or the use of prescription or over the counter drugs or alcohol for purposes other than those for which they are meant to be used, or in excessive amounts.
It may lead to social, physical, emotional, and job-related problems. The problem that most youth or students face is that they do not prioritize. 
The put substance first before their studies mostly alcohol. The intake of alcohol affects the students in a very bad way</font>

<h1 style="color:#0000ff">Types of substances:</h1>
<font style="font-size:20px">
<li>Stimulents </br>
<li>Depressants</br>
<li>Opium-Related painkillers</br>
<li>Hallucinogens</br>
</font></p>

	
<p><h1 style="color:#0000ff">What are Stimulents?</h1>
	
<font style="font-size:20px">Stimulants are a class of drugs that speed up messages travelling between the brain and body (includes the brain and spinal cord). Stimulants include caffeine, nicotine, amphetamines, and cocaine. 
They increase the levels of catecholamines—a family of brain chemicals that includes dopamine. These chemicals are used in the brain processes to signal reward and motivation. 
By increasing catecholamine levels, stimulants can temporarily increase a person’s energy level and alertness. They can make a person feel more awake, alert, confident or energetic. 
Stimulants may also cause other changes in the body. These products typically contain one or more of the following ingredients: caffeine, methylxanthines, B vitamins, guarana, yerba mate, bitter orange, ginger, ginkgo, St. John's Wort, ginseng, and taurine. 
The effects vary according to the specific drug, the amount of the drug, and how the drug is taken

<h1 style="color:#0000ff">What are the treatments for Stimulents</h1>
<font style="font-size:20px">Apart from nicotine (tobacco addiction), there are no medications approved to treat stimulant addiction. However, scientists are actively working in this area. 
They are studying different types of medications to help prevent cravings, reduce relapse, and address some of the mood and other problems that people addicted to stimulants often have. 
Scientists believe that a combination of medications (when they become available) and behavioural therapies will likely prove to be the most effective approach to treating stimulant addiction in the future.
If you or someone you know is abusing or addicted to stimulants, there are many drugs treatment programs and support groups that can help. Currently behavioural therapies are the most effective approach to treating stimulant addiction.
Treatment programs seek to engage people in therapy, reward abstinence, and/or to help change the way a drug user thinks and behaves when faced with situations that may lead to drug use.

<h1 style="color:#0000ff">What are Depressants?</h1>
<font style="font-size:20px">A depressant, or central depressant, is a drug that lowers neurotransmission levels, which is to depress or reduce arousal or stimulation, in various areas of the brain. 
Depressants are also occasionally referred to as "downers" as they lower the level of arousal when taken. these drugs come in multi-coloured tablets and capsules or in liquid form. 
Some drugs in this category,as they are supposed to reduce the symptoms of mental illness.Some drugs  are used as sedatives and sleeping pills

<img src="meecay.jpg" width="500" height="300">
<h1 style="color:#0000ff">Which drugs cause Depressants?</h1>
<font style="font-size:20px">
<li> Acne medications.
<li> Pain relievers.
<li> Allergy medications.
<li> Thyroid medications.
<li> Antibiotics.

</font>
<h1 style="color:#0000ff">Depressants's long-term effects.</h1>
<font style="font-size:20px">Long-term use of depressants can produce depression, chronic fatigue, breathing difficulties, sexual problems, and sleep problems. As a dependency on the drug increases, cravings, anxiety, or panic are common if the user is unable to get more.
Withdrawal symptoms include insomnia, weakness, and nausea. For continual and high-dose users, agitation, high body temperature, delirium, hallucinations, and convulsions can occur. 
Unlike withdrawal from most drugs, withdrawal from depressants can be life-threatening.
</font>
<h1 style="color:#0000ff"> Depressants's short-term</h1>
<font style="font-size:20px">
<li>Slow brain function
<li>Slowed pulse and breathing
<li>Lowered blood pressure
<li>Poor concentration
<li>Confusion
<li>Fatigue2
<li>Dizziness
<li>Slurred speech
<li>Fever
<li>Sluggishness
<li>Visual disturbances
<li>Dilated pupils
<li>Disorientation, lack of coordination
<li>Depression
<li>Difficulty or inability to urinate
<li>Addiction
<p>When treating depression, several drugs are available. Some of the most commonly used include: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram oxalate (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac), fluvoxamine (Luvox), paroxetine HRI (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft).</p>
</font>
</p>
<p><h1 style="color:#0000ff">What are Opium- Related painkillers?</h1>
<font style="font-size:20px">An addiction to Painkillers often begins after someone is prescribed the medication for pain following an accident or injury. Patients are given a prescription and specified dose from a doctor; often patients have no intention of abusing the medication.
However, over a period, a person may feel that the drug is no longer as effective as it was in the beginning. This feeling is caused by an increased tolerance to the prescribed Painkiller, which means that the substance has built up within a person’s body.
A tolerance can also cause a person to take doses larger than their recommended amount to achieve the effects they want. Increasing the medication dosage can lead to a physical dependence whereby the user needs to continue taking the drug to feel normal. 
Eventually a physical dependence can lead to cravings, which are characterized by growing urges to continue using the drug despite negative consequences that may occur.

<h1 style="color:#0000ff">Types types of opium.</h1>
<font style="font-size:20px"><li>Opiate
<li>opioids

<p><h2 style="color:#0000ff">These are the two examples of Opium in which mostly are words that are used untagonistically and people might confuse them . </p></h2>
<p>Opiate-are substances with active ingredients that are naturally derived from Opium. Common Opiates include Morphine and Codeine, both of which are directly made from the Opium found in poppy plants.</p>
<p>Opioids- are synthetically manufactured substances that mimic the natural effects of Opium. Some Opioids are fully Synthetic, while others are only partially Synthetic meaning they still contain natural Opium.</p>
Both Opioids and Opiates work by activating receptors in the brain and depressing the central nervous system. When receptors become activated by one of these drugs, they release “feel-good” chemicals known as endorphins. The release of endorphins caused by Opiate or Opioid use leads to feelings of relaxation and calmness, which can be highly addicting.
</p></font>

<p><h1 style="color:#0000ff">Types of opiates.</h1>
<font style="font-size:20px">
<li>Antagonists-such as Naltrexone and Naloxone, are considered to be less addictive than agonists, though the potential for abuse still exists. They are often used to help with the detoxification process, which often takes place as the first part of addiction treatment.
<li>Agonist-mimic the effects of naturally-occurring endorphins in the body and produce an Opiate effect by interacting with specific receptor sites in the brain. Agonists include drugs like Morphine and Fentanyl, which are most commonly used in medical settings and have the strongest effects. Many substances in this category have a very high potential for abuse and addiction. Other examples of agonists include Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, Heroin, and Buprenorphine.
